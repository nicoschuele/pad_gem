# PadGem

PadGem is a Ruby gem generator. Part of the Padstone app builder. More info at [Padstone.io](http://padstone.io).

## Installation

Install it like any other Ruby gem:

`gem install pad_gem`

## Usage

To create a new gem, simply issue `padgem --new` in your terminal and follow the wizard.

## Notes

* Doesn't work on Windows (and probably never will except if somebody forks it and submits a pull request with the necessary changes).
* Although it works just fine, PadGem was not designed to be used as a standalone CLI utility. Thus, the things you set in the wizard are not checked and may fail miserably.
